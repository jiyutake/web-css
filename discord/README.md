## Amoled
This theme is based around [slugbyte/lackluster.nvim](https://github.com/slugbyte/lackluster.nvim/), and features a layout that puts channels/friends on the right side as well as hiding all elements other than the main chat. You can still access them using the rover feature, as shown on the preview:
